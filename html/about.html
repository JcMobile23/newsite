            in a family of four, I attended numerous pri/sec school due to the
            nature of my dad's job, I studied math/statistics at Imo State
            university at tertiary level. I've allways had the passion to fix
            electronic devices in general, far back as when i was a child, it
            all started with the curiousity of how and why a light bulb
            iluminate's, why/how a radio produces sound, how a television
            displays what it displays....countless questions to how things work,
            was what drived me to where i am today. i now concentrate that
            randon knowledge into specializing in mobile phone hardware
            engineering.
